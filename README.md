🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

- I met all of the baseline requirements:
-🎯 Use Clerk.com to set up user signup and login.
-🎯 Use the Clerk userId to associate posts with a user.
-🎯 Enable each user to create a profile associated with their userId, and a form to input their biography and location data, etc. with a URL similar to /user/[userId].
-🎯 Enable users to create posts associated with the userId, and display those posts on the user's profile page
-🎯 Show a 404 error if a user profile doesn't exist
-🎯 Use at least 1 Radix UI Primitive or similar

- I also achieved the following stretch goal (when you first open the site prior to logging in, you may need to refresh the page but you will be asked to add a username AND bio before you can post any meows):
🏹 A user's biography cannot be blank. If a user logs in but doesn't have a biography set, they should be asked to fill one in
- I also achieved this stretch user story:
-🐿️ As a user, I am able to see a list of other user's posts and/or profiles on the site (ALL POSTS on the ALL MEOWS page)

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
-I achieved all of the baseline requirements, one stretch goal and one stretch user story.

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
-I had one less day to work on the assignment due to an interview so I am happy with what I completed in the time given with a little extra outside of this in my own time.

(Optional)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.

What went really well and what could have gone better?
- I really enjoyed the code along style of teaching this week. I found it difficult to know which items could have been made into separate components but think this will come with practice.

Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.
- At one point I had trouble with the global posts showing on the individual profile page, and the posts by one user showing as being posted by all of the users individually.
- When you first sign up and return to the homepage, you need to refresh for the username and bio form to load up
- During testing, I set up the 404 error using not-found and it was working (and does work if you type an incorrect page link, like /postss (not /posts), however when first signing up it was sometimes throwing the standard error page for next.js

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
- Just general feedback please.
